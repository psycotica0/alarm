Quick alarm thing I wrote one night because I had to get up at a particular time the next morning.

Essentially, I have one script that saves the state of mpd, then loads a playlist called "alarm".
It plays that until you hit enter, then it restores the state of mpd.

That's the alarm.

The other part is a script that uses at to handle having the alarm go off at the right time, along with snooze.
The script will snooze indefinitely, but you can use atq and atrm to remove the next iteration, which will stop it.
